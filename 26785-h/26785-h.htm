<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<h3><i>The New Influences and Tendencies</i></h3>

<p>Mere statistics are untrustworthy; dates are even less
dependable. But, to avoid hairsplitting, what we call
"modern" English literature may be said to date from
about 1885. A few writers who are decidedly "of the
period" are, as a matter of strict chronology, somewhat
earlier. But the chief tendencies may be divided into
seven periods. They are (1) The decay of Victorianism
and the growth of a purely decorative art, (2) The rise
and decline of the &AElig;sthetic Philosophy, (3) The muscular
influence of Henley, (4) The Celtic revival in Ireland,
(5) Rudyard Kipling and the ascendency of
mechanism in art, (6) John Masefield and the return of
the rhymed narrative, (7) The war and the appearance
of "The Georgians." It may be interesting to trace
these developments in somewhat greater detail.</p>


<h3><span class='smcap'>the end of victorianism</span></h3>

<p>The age commonly called Victorian came to an end
about 1885. It was an age distinguished by many true
idealists and many false ideals. It was, in spite of its
notable artists, on an entirely different level from the
epoch which had preceded it. Its poetry was, in the main,
not universal but parochial; its romanticism was gilt
and tinsel; its realism was as cheap as its showy glass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
pendants, red plush, parlor chromos and antimacassars.
The period was full of a pessimistic resignation (the note
popularized by Fitzgerald's Omar Khayy&aacute;m) and a kind
of cowardice or at least a negation which, refusing to see
any glamour in the actual world, turned to the Middle
Ages, King Arthur, the legend of Troy&mdash;to the suave
surroundings of a dream-world instead of the hard contours
of actual experience.</p>

<p>At its worst, it was a period of smugness, of placid and
pious sentimentality&mdash;epitomized by the rhymed sermons
of Martin Farquhar Tupper, whose <i>Proverbial Philosophy</i>
was devoured with all its cloying and indigestible sweetmeats
by thousands. The same tendency is apparent,
though far less objectionably, in the moralizing lays of
Lord Thomas Macaulay, in the theatrically emotionalized
verses of Robert Buchanan, Edwin Arnold and Sir Lewis
Morris&mdash;even in the lesser later work of Alfred Tennyson.</p>

<p>And, without Tupper's emptiness or absurdities, the
outworn platitudes again find their constant lover in
Alfred Austin, Tennyson's successor as poet laureate.
Austin brought the laureateship, which had been held by
poets like Ben Jonson, Dryden, Southey and Wordsworth,
to an incredibly low level; he took the thinning stream
of garrulous poetic conventionality, reduced it to the
merest trickle&mdash;and diluted it.</p>

<p>The poets of a generation before this time were fired
with such ideas as freedom, a deep and burning awe of
nature, an insatiable hunger for truth in all its forms and
manifestations. The characteristic poets of the Victorian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Era, says Max Plowman, "wrote under the dominance of
churchliness, of 'sweetness and light,' and a thousand
lesser theories that have not truth but comfort for their
end."</p>

<p>The revolt against this and the tawdriness of the period
had already begun; the best of Victorianism can be found
not in men who were typically Victorian, but in pioneers
like Browning and writers like Swinburne, Rossetti,
William Morris, who were completely out of sympathy
with their time.</p>

<p>But it was Oscar Wilde who led the men of the now
famous 'nineties toward an &aelig;sthetic freedom, to champion
a beauty whose existence was its "own excuse for being."
Wilde's was, in the most outspoken manner, the first use
of &aelig;stheticism as a slogan; the battle-cry of the group was
actually the now outworn but then revolutionary "Art
for Art's sake"! And, so sick were people of the shoddy
ornaments and drab ugliness of the immediate past, that
the slogan won. At least, temporarily.</p>


<h3><span class='smcap'>the rise and decline of the &aelig;sthetic philosophy</span></h3>

<p><i>The Yellow Book</i>, the organ of a group of young
writers and artists, appeared (1894-97), representing a
reasoned and intellectual reaction, mainly suggested and
influenced by the French. The group of contributors was
a peculiarly mixed one with only one thing in common.
And that was a conscious effort to repudiate the sugary
airs and prim romantics of the Victorian Era.</p>

<p>Almost the first act of the "new" men was to rouse
and outrage their immediate predecessors. This end-of-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>the-century
desire to shock, which was so strong and
natural an impulse, still has a place of its own&mdash;especially
as an antidote, a harsh corrective. Mid-Victorian propriety
and self-satisfaction crumbled under the swift and
energetic audacities of the sensational younger authors
and artists; the old walls fell; the public, once so apathetic
to <i>belles lettres</i>, was more than attentive to every phase
of literary experimentation. The last decade of the nineteenth
century was so tolerant of novelty in art and
ideas, that it would seem, says Holbrook Jackson in his
penetrative summary, <i>The Eighteen-Nineties</i>, "as though
the declining century wished to make amends for several
decades of artistic monotony. It may indeed be something
more than a coincidence that placed this decade at the
close of a century, and <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> may have been at
once a swan song and a death-bed repentance."</p>

<p>But later on, the movement (if such it may be called),
surfeited with its own excesses, fell into the mere poses
of revolt; it degenerated into a half-hearted defense of
artificialities.</p>

<p>It scarcely needed W. S. Gilbert (in <i>Patience</i>) or
Robert Hichens (in <i>The Green Carnation</i>) to satirize
its distorted attitudinizing. It strained itself to death;
it became its own burlesque of the bizarre, an extravaganza
of extravagance. "The period" (I am again quoting
Holbrook Jackson) "was as certainly a period of
decadence as it was a period of renaissance. The decadence
was to be seen in a perverse and finicking glorification
of the fine arts and mere artistic virtuosity on the
one hand, and a militant commercial movement on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
other.... The eroticism which became so prevalent
in the verse of many of the younger poets was minor
because it was little more than a pose&mdash;not because it
was erotic.... It was a passing mood which gave the
poetry of the hour a hothouse fragrance; a perfume faint
yet unmistakable and strange."</p>

<p>But most of the elegant and disillusioned young men
overshot their mark. Mere health reasserted itself; an
inherent repressed vitality sought new channels. Arthur
Symons deserted his hectic Muse, Richard Le Gallienne
abandoned his preciosity, and the group began to disintegrate.
The &aelig;sthetic philosophy was wearing thin; it
had already begun to fray and reveal its essential shabbiness.
Wilde himself possessed the three things which
he said the English would never forgive&mdash;youth, power
and enthusiasm. But in trying to make an exclusive cult
of beauty, Wilde had also tried to make it evade actuality;
he urged that art should not, in any sense, be a part of
life but an escape from it. "The proper school to learn
art in is not Life&mdash;but Art." And in the same essay
("The Decay of Lying") he wrote, "All bad Art
comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating
them into ideals." Elsewhere he said, "The first duty
in life is to be as artificial as possible. What the second
duty is no one has discovered."</p>

<p>Such a cynical and decadent philosophy could not go
unchallenged. Its aristocratic blue-bloodedness was
bound to arouse the red blood of common reality. This
negative attitude received its answer in the work of that
yea-sayer, W. E. Henley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class='smcap'>william ernest henley</span></h3>

<p>Henley repudiated this languid &aelig;stheticism; he scorned
a negative art which was out of touch with the world.
His was a large and sweeping affirmation. He felt that
mere existence was glorious; life was coarse, difficult, often
dangerous and dirty, but splendid at the heart. Art, he
knew, could not be separated from the dreams and hungers
of man; it could not flourish only on its own essences or
technical accomplishments. To live, poetry would have to
share the fears, angers, hopes and struggles of the prosaic
world. And so Henley came like a swift salt breeze
blowing through a perfumed and heavily-screened studio.
He sang loudly (sometimes even too loudly) of the joy
of living and the courage of the "unconquerable soul."
He was a powerful influence not only as a poet but as a
critic and editor. In the latter capacity he gathered about
him such men as Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling,
Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, W. B. Yeats, T. E.
Brown, J. M. Barrie. None of these men were his disciples,
but none of them came into contact with him
without being influenced in some way by his sharp and
positive personality. A pioneer and something of a
prophet, he was one of the first to champion the paintings
of Whistler and to proclaim the genius of the sculptor
Rodin.</p>

<p>If at times Henley's verse is imperialistic, over-muscular
and strident, his noisy moments are redeemed not only
by his delicate lyrics but by his passionate enthusiasm for
nobility in whatever cause it was joined. He never dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>dained
the actual world in any of its moods&mdash;bus-drivers,
hospital interiors, scrubwomen, a panting train, the
squalor of London's alleys, all found a voice in his lines&mdash;and
his later work contains more than a hint of the
delight in science and machinery which was later to be
sounded more fully in the work of Rudyard Kipling.</p>


<h3><span class='smcap'>the celtic revival and j. m. synge</span></h3>

<p>In 1889, William Butler Yeats published his <i>Wanderings
of Oisin</i>; in the same year Douglas Hyde, the
scholar and folk-lorist, brought out his <i>Book of Gaelic
Stories</i>.</p>

<p>The revival of Gaelic and the renascence of Irish literature
may be said to date from the publication of those two
books. The fundamental idea of both men and their followers
was the same. It was to create a literature which
would express the national consciousness of Ireland
through a purely national art. They began to reflect the
strange background of dreams, politics, suffering and heroism
that is immortally Irish. This community of fellowship
and aims is to be found in the varied but allied work
of William Butler Yeats, "A. E." (George W. Russell),
Moira O'Neill, Lionel Johnson, Katharine Tynan,
Padraic Colum and others. The first fervor gone, a
short period of dullness set in. After reanimating the old
myths, surcharging the legendary heroes with a new significance,
it seemed for a while that the movement would
lose itself in a literary mysticism. But an increasing
concern with the peasant, the migratory laborer, the
tramp, followed; an interest that was something of a re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>action
against the influence of Yeats and his mystic otherworldliness.
And, in 1904, the Celtic Revival reached its
height with John Millington Synge, who was not only
the greatest dramatist of the Irish Theatre, but (to quote
such contrary critics as George Moore and Harold
Williams) "one of the greatest dramatists who has
written in English." Synge's poetry, brusque and all too
small in quantity, was a minor occupation with him and
yet the quality and power of it is unmistakable. Its
content is never great but the raw vigor in it was to
serve as a bold banner&mdash;a sort of a brilliant Jolly Roger&mdash;for
the younger men of the following period. It was
not only this dramatist's brief verses and his intensely
musical prose but his sharp prefaces that were to exercise
such an influence.</p>

<p>In the notable introduction to the <i>Playboy of the Western
World</i>, Synge declared, "When I was writing <i>The
Shadow of the Glen</i> some years ago, I got more aid than
any learning could have given me from a chink in the
floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that
let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in
the kitchen. This matter is, I think, of some importance;
for in countries where the imagination of the people, and
the language they use, is rich and living, it is possible
for a writer to be rich and copious in his words&mdash;and at
the same time to give the reality which is at the root of
all poetry, in a natural and comprehensive form." This
quotation explains his idiom, possibly the sharpest-flavored
and most vivid in modern literature.</p>

<p>As to Synge's poetic power, it is unquestionably great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>est
in his plays. In <i>The Well of the Saints</i>, <i>The Playboy
of the Western World</i> and <i>Riders to the Sea</i> there are
more poignance, beauty of form and richness of language
than in any piece of dramatic writing since Elizabethan
times. Yeats, when he first heard Synge's early one-act
play, <i>The Shadow of the Glen</i>, is said to have exclaimed
"Euripides." A half year later when Synge read him
<i>Riders to the Sea</i>, Yeats again confined his enthusiasm to
a single word:&mdash;"&AElig;schylus!" Years have shown that
Yeats's appreciation was not as exaggerated as many might
suppose.</p>

<p>But although Synge's poetry was not his major concern,
numbering only twenty-four original pieces and
eighteen translations, it had a surprising effect upon his
followers. It marked a point of departure, a reaction
against both the too-polished and over-rhetorical verse of
his immediate predecessors and the dehumanized mysticism
of many of his associates. In that memorable preface to
his <i>Poems</i> he wrote what was a slogan, a manifesto and
at the same time a classic <i>credo</i> for all that we call the
"new" poetry. "I have often thought," it begins, "that
at the side of poetic diction, which everyone condemns,
modern verse contains a great deal of poetic material,
using 'poetic' in the same special sense. The poetry of
exaltation will be always the highest; but when men lose
their poetic feeling for ordinary life and cannot write
poetry of ordinary things, their exalted poetry is likely to
lose its strength of exaltation in the way that men cease
to build beautiful churches when they have lost happiness
in building shops.... Even if we grant that exalted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
poetry can be kept successfully by itself, the strong things
of life are needed in poetry also, to show that what is
exalted or tender is not made by feeble blood."</p>


<h3><span class='smcap'>rudyard kipling</span></h3>

<p>New tendencies are contagious. But they also disclose
themselves simultaneously in places and people where
there has been no point of contact. Even before Synge
published his proofs of the keen poetry in everyday life,
Kipling was illuminating, in a totally different manner,
the wealth of poetic material in things hitherto regarded
as too commonplace for poetry. Before literary England
had quite recovered from its surfeit of Victorian priggishness
and pre-Raphaelite delicacy, Kipling came along with
high spirits and a great tide of life, sweeping all before
him. An obscure Anglo-Indian journalist, the publication
of his <i>Barrack-room Ballads</i> in 1892 brought him sudden
notice. By 1895 he was internationally famous. Brushing
over the pallid attempts to revive a pallid past, he
rode triumphantly on a wave of buoyant and sometimes
brutal joy in the present. Kipling gloried in the material
world; he did more&mdash;he glorified it. He pierced the
coarse exteriors of seemingly prosaic things&mdash;things like
machinery, bridge-building, cockney soldiers, slang, steam,
the dirty by-products of science (witness "M'Andrews
Hymn" and "The Bell Buoy")&mdash;and uncovered their
hidden glamour. "Romance is gone," sighed most of his
contemporaries,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"... and all unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Romance brought up the nine-fifteen."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span></div></div>

<p>That sentence (from his poem "The King") contains
the key to the manner in which the author of <i>The Five
Nations</i> helped to rejuvenate English verse.</p>

<p>Kipling, with his perception of ordinary people in terms
of ordinary life, was one of the strongest links between
the Wordsworth-Browning era and the latest apostles of
vigor, beginning with Masefield. There are occasional
and serious defects in Kipling's work&mdash;particularly in his
more facile poetry; he falls into a journalistic ease that
tends to turn into jingle; he is fond of a militaristic drum-banging
that is as blatant as the insularity he condemns.
But a burning, if sometimes too simple faith, shines
through his achievements. His best work reveals an intensity
that crystallizes into beauty what was originally
tawdry, that lifts the vulgar and incidental to the place
of the universal.</p>


<h3><span class='smcap'>john masefield</span></h3>

<p>All art is a twofold revivifying&mdash;a recreation of subject
and a reanimating of form. And poetry becomes perennially
"new" by returning to the old&mdash;with a different
consciousness, a greater awareness. In 1911, when art was
again searching for novelty, John Masefield created something
startling and new by going back to 1385 and <i>The
Canterbury Pilgrims</i>. Employing both the Chaucerian
model and a form similar to the practically forgotten
Byronic stanza, Masefield wrote in rapid succession, <i>The
Everlasting Mercy</i> (1911), <i>The Widow in the Bye
Street</i> (1912), <i>Dauber</i> (1912), <i>The Daffodil Fields</i>
(1913)&mdash;four astonishing rhymed narratives and four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
of the most remarkable poems of our generation. Expressive
of every rugged phase of life, these poems, uniting
old and new manners, responded to Synge's proclamation
that "the strong things of life are needed in poetry
also ... and it may almost be said that before verse
can be human again it must be brutal."</p>

<p>Masefield brought back to poetry that mixture of
beauty and brutality which is its most human and enduring
quality. He brought back that rich and almost
vulgar vividness which is the very life-blood of Chaucer,
of Shakespeare, of Burns, of Villon, of Heine&mdash;and of
all those who were not only great artists but great
humanists. As a purely descriptive poet, he can take his
place with the masters of sea and landscape. As an imaginative
realist, he showed those who were stumbling from
one wild eccentricity to another to thrill them, that they
themselves were wilder, stranger, far more thrilling than
anything in the world&mdash;or out of it. Few things in contemporary
poetry are as powerful as the regeneration of
Saul Kane (in <i>The Everlasting Mercy</i>) or the story of
<i>Dauber</i>, the tale of a tragic sea-voyage and a dreaming
youth who wanted to be a painter. The vigorous description
of rounding Cape Horn in the latter poem is superbly
done, a masterpiece in itself. Masefield's later volumes
are quieter in tone, more measured in technique; there
is an almost religious ring to many of his Shakespearian
sonnets. But the swinging surge is there, a passionate
strength that leaps through all his work from <i>Salt Water
Ballads</i> (1902) to <i>Reynard the Fox</i> (1919).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class='smcap'>"the georgians" and the younger men</span></h3>

<p>There is no sharp statistical line of demarcation between
Masefield and the younger men. Although several
of them owe much to him, most of the younger poets
speak in accents of their own. W. W. Gibson had
already reinforced the "return to actuality" by turning
from his first preoccupation with shining knights, faultless
queens, ladies in distress and all the paraphernalia of
hackneyed medi&aelig;val romances, to write about ferrymen,
berry-pickers, stone-cutters, farmers, printers, circus-men,
carpenters&mdash;dramatizing (though sometimes theatricalizing)
the primitive emotions of uncultured and ordinary
people in <i>Livelihood</i>, <i>Daily Bread</i> and <i>Fires</i>. This intensity
had been asking new questions. It found its
answers in the war; repressed emotionalism discovered a
new outlet. One hears its echoes in the younger poets
like Siegfried Sassoon, with his poignant and unsparing
poems of conflict; in Robert Graves, who reflects it
in a lighter and more fantastic vein; in James Stephens,
whose wild ingenuities are redolent of the soil. And it
finds its corresponding opposite in the limpid and unperturbed
loveliness of Ralph Hodgson; in the ghostly
magic and the nursery-rhyme whimsicality of Walter
de la Mare; in the quiet and delicate lyrics of W. H.
Davies. Among the others, the brilliant G. K. Chesterton,
the facile Alfred Noyes, the romantic Rupert Brooke
(who owes less to Masefield and his immediate predecessors
than he does to the passionately intellectual Donne),
the introspective D. H. Lawrence and the versatile J. C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
Squire, are perhaps best known to American readers.</p>

<p>All of the poets mentioned in the foregoing paragraph
(with the exception of Noyes) have formed themselves in
a loose group called "The Georgians," and an anthology
of their best work has appeared every two years since
1913. Masefield, Lascelles Abercrombie and John Drinkwater
are also listed among the Georgian poets. When
their first collection appeared in March, 1913, Henry
Newbolt, a critic as well as poet, wrote: "These younger
poets have no temptation to be false. They are not for
making something 'pretty,' something up to the standard
of professional patterns.... They write as grown
men walk, each with his own unconscious stride and gesture....
In short, they express themselves and seem
to steer without an effort between the dangers of innovation
and reminiscence." The secret of this success, and
for that matter, the success of the greater portion of
English poetry, is not an exclusive discovery of the
Georgian poets. It is their inheritance, derived from
those predecessors who, "from Wordsworth and Coleridge
onward, have worked for the assimilation of verse
to the manner and accent of natural speech." In its
adaptability no less than in its vigor, modern English
poetry is true to its period&mdash;and its past.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This collection is obviously a companion volume to
<i>Modern American Poetry</i>, which, in its restricted compass,
attempted to act as an introduction to recent native
verse. <i>Modern British Poetry</i> covers the same period
(from about 1870 to 1920), follows the same chrono<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>logical
scheme, but it is more amplified and goes into far
greater detail than its predecessor.</p>

<p>The two volumes, considered together, furnish interesting
contrasts; they reveal certain similarities and certain
strange differences. Broadly speaking, modern
American verse is sharp, vigorously experimental; full of
youth and its occasional&mdash;and natural&mdash;crudities. English
verse is smoother, more matured and, molded by
centuries of literature, richer in associations and surer
in artistry. Where the American output is often rude,
extremely varied and unco&ouml;rdinated (being the expression
of partly indigenous, partly naturalized and largely unassimilated
ideas, emotions, and races), the English product
is formulated, precise and, in spite of its fluctuations,
true to its past. It goes back to traditions as old as
Chaucer (witness the narratives of Masefield and
Gibson) or tendencies as classic as Drayton, Herrick and
Blake&mdash;as in the frank lyrics of A. E. Housman, the
artless lyricism of Ralph Hodgson, the na&iuml;f wonder of
W. H. Davies. And if English poetry may be compared
to a broad and luxuriating river (while American
poetry might be described as a sudden rush of unconnected
mountain torrents, valley streams and city sluices),
it will be inspiring to observe how its course has been
temporarily deflected in the last forty years; how it has
swung away from one tendency toward another; and
how, for all its bends and twists, it has lost neither its
strength nor its nobility.</p>

<h2><i>Thomas Hardy</i></h2>


<p>Thomas Hardy was born in 1840, and has for years been
famous on both sides of the Atlantic as a writer of intense and
sombre novels. His <i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i> and <i>Jude the
Obscure</i> are possibly his best known, although his <i>Wessex Tales</i>
and <i>Life's Little Ironies</i> are no less imposing.</p>

<p>It was not until he was almost sixty, in 1898 to be precise,
that Hardy abandoned prose and challenged attention as a poet.
<i>The Dynasts</i>, a drama of the Napoleonic Wars, is in three
parts, nineteen acts and one hundred and thirty scenes, a
massive and most amazing contribution to contemporary art.
It is the apotheosis of Hardy the novelist. Lascelles Abercrombie
calls this work, which is partly a historical play, partly
a visionary drama, "the biggest and most consistent exhibition
of fatalism in literature." While its powerful simplicity and
tragic impressiveness overshadow his shorter poems, many of
his terse lyrics reveal the same vigor and impact of a strong
personality. His collected poems were published by The Macmillan
Company in 1919 and reveal another phase of one of
the greatest living writers of English.</p>

<h2><i>Robert Bridges</i></h2>


<p>Robert Bridges was born in 1844 and educated at Eton and
Corpus Christi College, Oxford. After traveling extensively,
he studied medicine in London and practiced until 1882. Most
of his poems, like his occasional plays, are classical in tone as
well as treatment. He was appointed poet laureate in 1913,
following Alfred Austin. His command of the secrets of rhythm
and a subtle versification give his lines a firm delicacy and
beauty of pattern.</p>

<h2><i>Arthur O'Shaughnessy</i></h2>


<p>The Irish-English singer, Arthur William Edgar O'Shaughnessy,
was born in London in 1844. He was connected, for a
while, with the British Museum, and was transferred later to
the Department of Natural History. His first literary success,
<i>Epic of Women</i> (1870), promised a brilliant future for the
young poet, a promise strengthened by his <i>Music and Moonlight</i>
(1874). Always delicate in health, his hopes were dashed by
periods of illness and an early death in London in 1881.</p>

<p>The poem here reprinted is not only O'Shaughnessy's best, but
is, because of its perfect blending of music and message, one
of the immortal classics of our verse.</p>

<h2><i>William Ernest Henley</i></h2>


<p>William Ernest Henley was born in 1849 and was educated
at the Grammar School of Gloucester. From childhood he was
afflicted with a tuberculous disease which finally necessitated
the amputation of a foot. His <i>Hospital Verses</i>, those vivid
precursors of current free verse, were a record of the time
when he was at the infirmary at Edinburgh; they are sharp
with the sights, sensations, even the actual smells of the sickroom.
In spite (or, more probably, because) of his continued
poor health, Henley never ceased to worship strength and
energy; courage and a triumphant belief in a harsh world
shine out of the athletic <i>London Voluntaries</i> (1892) and the
lightest and most musical lyrics in <i>Hawthorn and Lavender</i>
(1898).</p>

<p>The bulk of Henley's poetry is not great in volume. He has
himself explained the small quantity of his work in a Preface
to his <i>Poems</i>, first published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1898.
"A principal reason," he says, "is that, after spending the
better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry, I found myself
(about 1877) so utterly unmarketable that I had to own myself
beaten in art, and to indict myself to journalism for the next
ten years." Later on, he began to write again&mdash;"old dusty
sheaves were dragged to light; the work of selection and cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>rection
was begun; I burned much; I found that, after all, the
lyrical instinct had slept&mdash;not died."</p>

<p>After a brilliant and varied career (see Preface), devoted
mostly to journalism, Henley died in 1903.</p>

<h2><i>Robert Louis Stevenson</i></h2>


<p>Robert Louis Stevenson was born at Edinburgh in 1850. He
was at first trained to be a lighthouse engineer, following the
profession of his family. However, he studied law instead;
was admitted to the bar in 1875; and abandoned law for
literature a few years later.</p>

<p>Though primarily a novelist, Stevenson has left one immortal
book of poetry which is equally at home in the nursery and
the library: <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i> (first published in
1885) is second only to Mother Goose's own collection in its
lyrical simplicity and universal appeal. <i>Underwoods</i> (1887)
and <i>Ballads</i> (1890) comprise his entire poetic output. As a
genial essayist, he is not unworthy to be ranked with Charles
Lamb. As a romancer, his fame rests securely on <i>Kidnapped</i>,
the unfinished masterpiece, <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>, and that eternal
classic of youth, <i>Treasure Island</i>.</p>

<p>Stevenson died after a long and dogged fight with his illness,
in the Samoan Islands in 1894.</p>

<h2><i>Fiona Macleod</i><br />
(<i>William Sharp</i>)</h2>


<p>William Sharp was born at Garthland Place, Scotland, in
1855. He wrote several volumes of biography and criticism,
published a book of plays greatly influenced by Maeterlinck
(<i>Vistas</i>) and was editor of "The Canterbury Poets" series.</p>

<p>His feminine <i>alter ego</i>, Fiona Macleod, was a far different
personality. Sharp actually believed himself possessed of another
spirit; under the spell of this other self, he wrote several
volumes of Celtic tales, beautiful tragic romances and no little
unusual poetry. Of the prose stories written by Fiona Macleod,
the most barbaric and vivid are those collected in <i>The Sin-Eater
and Other Tales</i>; the longer <i>Pharais, A Romance of the Isles</i>,
is scarcely less unique.</p>

<p>In the ten years, 1882-1891, William Sharp published four
volumes of rather undistinguished verse. In 1896 <i>From the
Hills of Dream</i> appeared over the signature of Fiona Macleod;
<i>The Hour of Beauty</i>, an even more distinctive collection, followed
shortly. Both poetry and prose were always the result
of two sharply differentiated moods constantly fluctuating; the
emotional mood was that of Fiona Macleod, the intellectual
and, it must be admitted the more arresting, was that of William
Sharp.</p>

<p>He died in 1905.</p>

<h2><i>Oscar Wilde</i></h2>


<p>Oscar Wilde was born at Dublin, Ireland, in 1856, and even
as an undergraduate at Oxford he was marked for a brilliant
career. When he was a trifle over 21 years of age, he won the
Newdigate Prize with his poem <i>Ravenna</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Giving himself almost entirely to prose, he speedily became
known as a writer of brilliant epigrammatic essays and even
more brilliant paradoxical plays such as <i>An Ideal Husband</i> and
<i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>. His aphorisms and flippancies
were quoted everywhere; his fame as a wit was only
surpassed by his notoriety as an &aelig;sthete. (See Preface.)</p>

<p>Most of his poems in prose (such as <i>The Happy Prince</i>, <i>The
Birthday of the Infanta</i> and <i>The Fisherman and His Soul</i>)
are more imaginative and richly colored than his verse; but
in one long poem, <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i> (1898), he
sounded his deepest, simplest and most enduring note. Prison
was, in many ways, a regeneration for Wilde. It not only
produced <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i> but made possible his
most poignant piece of writing, <i>De Profundis</i>, only a small
part of which has been published. <i>Salom&eacute;</i>, which has made
the author's name a household word, was originally written in
French in 1892 and later translated into English by Lord
Alfred Douglas, accompanied by the famous illustrations by
Aubrey Beardsley. More recently this heated drama, based
on the story of Herod and Herodias, was made into an opera
by Richard Strauss.</p>

<p>Wilde's society plays, flashing and cynical, were the forerunners
of Bernard Shaw's audacious and far more searching
ironies. One sees the origin of a whole school of drama in
such epigrams as "The history of woman is the history of the
worst form of tyranny the world has ever known: the tyranny
of the weak over the strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts."
Or "There is only one thing in the world worse than being
talked about, and that is not being talked about."</p>

<p>Wilde died at Paris, November 30, 1900.</p>

<h2><i>John Davidson</i></h2>


<p>John Davidson was born at Barrhead, Renfrewshire, in 1857.
His <i>Ballads and Songs</i> (1895) and <i>New Ballads</i> (1897) attained
a sudden but too short-lived popularity, and his great
promise was quenched by an apathetic public and by his own
growing disillusion and despair. His sombre yet direct poetry
never tired of repeating his favorite theme: "Man is but the
Universe grown conscious."</p>

<p>Davidson died by his own hand in 1909.</p>

<h2><i>William Watson</i></h2>


<p>William Watson was born at Burley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire,
August 2, 1858. He achieved his first wide success
through his long and eloquent poems on Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Tennyson&mdash;poems that attempted, and sometimes successfully,
to combine the manners of these masters. <i>The Hope of
the World</i> (1897) contains some of his most characteristic verse.</p>

<p>It was understood that he would be appointed poet laureate
upon the death of Alfred Austin. But some of his radical and
semi-political poems are supposed to have displeased the pow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>ers
at Court, and the honor went to Robert Bridges. His best
work, which is notable for its dignity and moulded imagination,
may be found in <i>Selected Poems</i>, published in 1903 by
John Lane Co.</p>

<h2><i>Francis Thompson</i></h2>


<p>Born in 1859 at Preston, Francis Thompson was educated at
Owen's College, Manchester. Later he tried all manner of
strange ways of earning a living. He was, at various times,
assistant in a boot-shop, medical student, collector for a book
seller and homeless vagabond; there was a period in his life
when he sold matches on the streets of London. He was
discovered in terrible poverty (having given up everything except
poetry and opium) by the editor of a magazine to which
he had sent some verses the year before. Almost immediately
thereafter he became famous. His exalted mysticism is seen
at its purest in "A Fallen Yew" and "The Hound of Heaven."
Coventry Patmore, the distinguished poet of an earlier period,
says of the latter poem, which is unfortunately too long to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
quote, "It is one of the very few <i>great</i> odes of which our
language can boast."</p>

<p>Thompson died, after a fragile and spasmodic life, in St.
John's Wood in November, 1907.</p>

<h2><i>A. E. Housman</i></h2>


<p>A. E. Housman was born March 26, 1859, and, after a classical
education, he was, for ten years, a Higher Division Clerk
in H. M. Patent Office. Later in life, he became a teacher.</p>

<p>Housman has published only one volume of original verse,
but that volume (<i>A Shropshire Lad</i>) is known wherever modern
English poetry is read. Originally published in 1896, when
Housman was almost 37, it is evident that many of these lyrics
were written when the poet was much younger. Echoing the
frank pessimism of Hardy and the harder cynicism of Heine,
Housman struck a lighter and more buoyant note. Underneath
his dark ironies, there is a rustic humor that has many subtle
variations. From a melodic standpoint, <i>A Shropshire Lad</i> is a
collection of exquisite, haunting and almost perfect songs.</p>

<p>Housman has been a professor of Latin since 1892 and, besides
his immortal set of lyrics, has edited Juvenal and the
books of Manilius.</p>

<h2><i>Douglas Hyde</i></h2>


<p>Doctor Douglas Hyde was born in Roscommon County, Ireland
in, as nearly as can be ascertained, 1860. One of the
most brilliant Irish scholars of his day, he has worked indefatigably
for the cause of his native letters. He has written a
comprehensive history of Irish literature; has compiled, edited
and translated into English the <i>Love Songs of Connaught</i>; is
President of The Irish National Literary Society; and is the
author of innumerable poems in Gaelic&mdash;far more than he ever
wrote in English. His collections of Irish folk-lore and poetry
were among the most notable contributions to the Celtic revival;
they were (see Preface), to a large extent, responsible for it.
Since 1909 he has been Professor of Modern Irish in University
College, Dublin.</p>

<p>The poem which is here quoted is one of his many brilliant
and reanimating translations. In its music and its peculiar
rhyme-scheme, it reproduces the peculiar flavor as well as the
meter of the West Irish original.</p>

<h2><i>Owen Seaman</i></h2>


<p>One of the most delightful of English versifiers, Owen Seaman,
was born in 1861. After receiving a classical education,
he became Professor of Literature and began to write for
Punch in 1894. In 1906 he was made editor of that internationally
famous weekly, remaining in that capacity ever since.
He was knighted in 1914. As a writer of light verse and as a
parodist, his agile work has delighted a generation of admirers.

<h2><i>Henry Newbolt</i></h2>


<p>Henry Newbolt was born at Bilston in 1862. His early work
was frankly imitative of Tennyson; he even attempted to add
to the Arthurian legends with a drama in blank verse entitled
<i>Mordred</i> (1895). It was not until he wrote his sea-ballads
that he struck his own note. With the publication of <i>Admirals
All</i> (1897) his fame was widespread. The popularity of his
lines was due not so much to the subject-matter of Newbolt's
verse as to the breeziness of his music, the solid beat of rhythm,
the vigorous swing of his stanzas.</p>

<p>In 1898 Newbolt published <i>The Island Race</i>, which contains
about thirty more of his buoyant songs of the sea. Besides
being a poet, Newbolt has written many essays and his critical
volume, <i>A New Study of English Poetry</i> (1917), is a collection
of articles that are both analytical and alive.</p>

<h2><i>Arthur Symons</i></h2>


<p>Born in 1865, Arthur Symons' first few publications revealed
an intellectual rather than an emotional passion. Those volumes
were full of the artifice of the period, but Symons's technical
skill and frequent analysis often saved the poems from
complete decadence. His later books are less imitative; the
influence of Verlaine and Baudelaire is not so apparent; the
sophistication is less cynical, the sensuousness more restrained.
His various collections of essays and stories reflect the same
peculiar blend of rich intellectuality and perfumed romanticism
that one finds in his most characteristic poems.</p>

<p>Of his many volumes in prose, <i>Spiritual Adventures</i> (1905),
while obviously influenced by Walter Pater, is by far the most
original; a truly unique volume of psychological short stories.
The best of his poetry up to 1902 was collected in two volumes,
<i>Poems</i>, published by John Lane Co. <i>The Fool of the World</i>
appeared in 1907.</p>

<h2><i>William Butler Yeats</i></h2>


<p>Born at Sandymount, Dublin, in 1865, the son of John B.
Yeats, the Irish artist, the greater part of William Butler
Yeats' childhood was spent in Sligo. Here he became imbued
with the power and richness of native folk-lore; he drank in the
racy quality through the quaint fairy stories and old wives'
tales of the Irish peasantry. (Later he published a collection
of these same stories.)</p>

<p>It was in the activities of a "Young Ireland" society that
Yeats became identified with the new spirit; he dreamed of a
national poetry that would be written in English and yet would
be definitely Irish. In a few years he became one of the
leaders in the Celtic revival. He worked incessantly for the
cause, both as propagandist and playwright; and, though his
mysticism at times seemed the product of a cult rather than a
Celt, his symbolic dramas were acknowledged to be full of a
haunting, other-world spirituality. (See Preface.) <i>The Hour
Glass</i> (1904), his second volume of "Plays for an Irish
Theatre," includes his best one-act dramas with the exception
of his unforgettable <i>The Land of Heart's Desire</i> (1894). <i>The
Wind Among the Reeds</i> (1899) contains several of his most
beautiful and characteristic poems.</p>

<p>Others who followed Yeats have intensified the Irish drama;
they have established a closer contact between the peasant and
poet. No one, however, has had so great a part in the shaping
of modern drama in Ireland as Yeats. His <i>Deirdre</i> (1907), a
beautiful retelling of the great Gaelic legend, is far more dramatic
than the earlier plays; it is particularly interesting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
read with Synge's more idiomatic play on the same theme,
<i>Deirdre of the Sorrows</i>.</p>

<p>The poems of Yeats which are quoted here reveal him in
his most lyric and musical vein.</p>

<h2><i>Rudyard Kipling</i></h2>


<p>Born at Bombay, India, December 30, 1865, Rudyard Kipling,
the author of a dozen contemporary classics, was educated in
England. He returned, however, to India and took a position
on the staff of "The Lahore Civil and Military Gazette,"
writing for the Indian press until about 1890, when he went to
England, where he has lived ever since, with the exception of
a short sojourn in America.</p>

<p>Even while he was still in India he achieved a popular as
well as a literary success with his dramatic and skilful tales,
sketches and ballads of Anglo-Indian life.</p>

<p><i>Soldiers Three</i> (1888) was the first of six collections of short
stories brought out in "Wheeler's Railway Library." They
were followed by the far more sensitive and searching <i>Plain
Tales from the Hills</i>, <i>Under the Deodars</i> and <i>The Phantom
'Rikshaw</i>, which contains two of the best and most convincing
ghost-stories in recent literature.</p>

<p>These tales, however, display only one side of Kipling's extraordinary
talents. As a writer of children's stories, he has
few living equals. <i>Wee Willie Winkie</i>, which contains that
stirring and heroic fragment "Drums of the Fore and Aft," is
only a trifle less notable than his more obviously juvenile collections.
<i>Just-So Stories</i> and the two <i>Jungle Books</i> (prose
interspersed with lively rhymes) are classics for young people
of all ages. <i>Kim</i>, the novel of a super-Mowgli grown up,
is a more mature masterpiece.</p>

<p>Considered solely as a poet (see Preface) he is one of the
most vigorous and unique figures of his time. The spirit of
romance surges under his realities. His brisk lines conjure up
the tang of a countryside in autumn, the tingle of salt spray,
the rude sentiment of ruder natures, the snapping of a banner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the lurch and rumble of the sea. His poetry is woven of the
stuff of myths; but it never loses its hold on actualities. Kipling
himself in his poem "The Benefactors" (from <i>The Years
Between</i> [1919]) writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! What avails the classic bent<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And what the cultured word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the undoctored incident<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That actually occurred?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kipling won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. His
varied poems have finally been collected in a remarkable one-volume
<i>Inclusive Edition</i> (1885-1918), an indispensable part of
any student's library. This gifted and prolific creator, whose
work was affected by the war, has frequently lapsed into bombast
and a journalistic imperialism. At his best he is unforgettable,
standing mountain-high above his host of imitators.
His home is at Burwash, Sussex.</p>

<h2><i>Richard Le Gallienne</i></h2>


<p>Richard Le Gallienne, who, in spite of his long residence in
the United States, must be considered an English poet, was born
at Liverpool in 1866. He entered on a business career soon
after leaving Liverpool College, but gave up commercial life
to become a man of letters after five or six years.</p>

<p>His early work was strongly influenced by the artificialities
of the &aelig;sthetic movement (see Preface); the indebtedness to
Oscar Wilde is especially evident. A little later Keats was the
dominant influence, and <i>English Poems</i> (1892) betray how deep
were Le Gallienne's admirations. His more recent poems in
<i>The Lonely Dancer</i> (1913) show a keener individuality and a
finer lyrical passion. His prose fancies are well known&mdash;par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>ticularly
<i>The Book Bills of Narcissus</i> and the charming and
high-spirited fantasia, <i>The Quest of the Golden Girl</i>.</p>

<p>Le Gallienne came to America about 1905 and has lived ever
since in Rowayton, Conn., and New York City.</p>

<h2><i>Lionel Johnson</i></h2>


<p>Born in 1867, Lionel Johnson received a classical education
at Oxford, and his poetry is a faithful reflection of his studies
in Greek and Latin literatures. Though he allied himself with
the modern Irish poets, his Celtic origin is a literary myth;
Johnson, having been converted to Catholicism in 1891, became
imbued with Catholic and, later, with Irish traditions. His
verse, while sometimes strained and over-decorated, is chastely
designed, rich and, like that of the Cavalier poets of the seventeenth
century, mystically devotional. <i>Poems</i> (1895) contains his
best work. Johnson died in 1902.</p>

<h2><i>Ernest Dowson</i></h2>


<p>Ernest Dowson was born at Belmont Hill in Kent in 1867.
His great-uncle was Alfred Domett (Browning's "Waring"),
who was at one time Prime Minister of New Zealand. Dowson,
practically an invalid all his life, was reckless with himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and, as disease weakened him more and more, hid himself in
miserable surroundings; for almost two years he lived in sordid
supper-houses known as "cabmen's shelters." He literally
drank himself to death.</p>

<p>His delicate and fantastic poetry was an attempt to escape
from a reality too big and brutal for him. His passionate lyric,
"I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion," a
triumph of despair and disillusion, is an outburst in which
Dowson epitomized himself&mdash;"One of the greatest lyrical poems
of our time," writes Arthur Symons, "in it he has for once said
everything, and he has said it to an intoxicating and perhaps
immortal music."</p>

<p>Dowson died obscure in 1900, one of the finest of modern
minor poets. His life was the tragedy of a weak nature buffeted
by a strong and merciless environment.</p>

<h2>"<i>A. E.</i>"<br />
(<i>George William Russell</i>)</h2>


<p>At Durgan, a tiny town in the north of Ireland, George
William Russell was born in 1867. He moved to Dublin when
he was 10 years old and, as a young man, helped to form
the group that gave rise to the Irish Renascence&mdash;the group of
which William Butler Yeats, Doctor Douglas Hyde, Katharine
Tynan and Lady Gregory were brilliant members. Besides
being a splendid mystical poet, "A. E." is a painter of note,
a fiery patriot, a distinguished sociologist, a public speaker, a
student of economics and one of the heads of the Irish Agricultural
Association.</p>

<p>The best of his poetry is in <i>Homeward Songs by the Way</i>
(1894) and <i>The Earth Breath and Other Poems</i>. Yeats has
spoken of these poems as "revealing in all things a kind of
scented flame consuming them from within."</p>

<h2><i>Stephen Phillips</i></h2>


<p>Born in 1868, Stephen Phillips is best known as the author of
<i>Herod</i> (1900), <i>Paola and Francesca</i> (1899), and <i>Ulysses</i>
(1902); a poetic playwright who succeeded in reviving, for a
brief interval, the blank verse drama on the modern stage.
Hailed at first with extravagant and almost incredible praise,
Phillips lived to see his most popular dramas discarded and
his new ones, such as <i>Pietro of Siena</i> (1910), unproduced and
unnoticed.</p>

<p>Phillips failed to "restore" poetic drama because he was,
first of all, a lyric rather than a dramatic poet. In spite of
certain moments of rhetorical splendor, his scenes are spectacular
instead of emotional; his inspiration is too often derived
from other models. He died in 1915.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2><i>Laurence Binyon</i></h2>


<p>Laurence Binyon was born at Lancaster, August 10, 1869, a
cousin of Stephen Phillips; in <i>Primavera</i> (1890) their early
poems appeared together. Binyon's subsequent volumes showed
little distinction until he published <i>London Visions</i>, which, in an
enlarged edition in 1908, revealed a gift of characterization
and a turn of speech in surprising contrast to his previous
academic <i>Lyrical Poems</i> (1894). His <i>Odes</i> (1901) contains his
ripest work; two poems in particular, "The Threshold" and
"The Bacchanal of Alexander," are glowing and unusually
spontaneous.</p>

<p>Binyon's power has continued to grow; age has given his
verse a new sharpness. "The House That Was," one of his
most recent poems, appeared in <i>The London Mercury</i>, November,
1919.</p>

of Oscar Wilde. One of the minor poets of "the eighteen-nineties,"
several of his poems rise above his own affectations and
the end-of-the-century decadence. <i>The City of the Soul</i> (1899)
and <i>Sonnets</i> (1900) contain his most graceful writing.</p>

<h2><i>T. Sturge Moore</i></h2>


<p>Thomas Sturge Moore was born March 4, 1870. He is well
known not only as an author, but as a critic and wood-engraver.
As an artist, he has achieved no little distinction and
has designed the covers for the poetry of W. B. Yeats and
others. As a poet, the greater portion of his verse is severely
classical in tone, academic in expression but, of its kind, dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>tinctive
and intimate. Among his many volumes, the most
outstanding are <i>The Vinedresser and Other Poems</i> (1899), <i>A
Sicilian Idyll</i> (1911) and <i>The Sea Is Kind</i> (1914).</p>

<h2><i>William H. Davies</i></h2>


<p>According to his own biography, William H. Davies was
born in a public-house called Church House at Newport, in
the County of Monmouthshire, April 20, 1870, of Welsh parents.
He was, until Bernard Shaw "discovered" him, a cattleman, a
berry-picker, a panhandler&mdash;in short, a vagabond. In a preface
to Davies' second book, <i>The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp</i>
(1906), Shaw describes how the manuscript came into his
hands:</p>

<p>"In the year 1905 I received by post a volume of poems
by one William H. Davies, whose address was The Farm
House, Kensington, S. E. I was surprised to learn that there
was still a farmhouse left in Kensington; for I did not then
suspect that the Farm House, like the Shepherdess Walks and
Nightingale Lane and Whetstone Parks of Bethnal Green and
Holborn, is so called nowadays in irony, and is, in fact, a
doss-house, or hostelry, where single men can have a night's
lodging, for, at most, sixpence.... The author, as far as I
could guess, had walked into a printer's or stationer's shop;
handed in his manuscript; and ordered his book as he might
have ordered a pair of boots. It was marked 'price, half a
crown.' An accompanying letter asked me very civilly if I
required a half-crown book of verses; and if so, would I
please send the author the half crown: if not, would I return
the book. This was attractively simple and sensible. I opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the book, and was more puzzled than ever; for before I had
read three lines I perceived that the author was a real poet.
His work was not in the least strenuous or modern; there was
indeed no sign of his ever having read anything otherwise than
as a child reads.... Here, I saw, was a genuine innocent,
writing odds and ends of verse about odds and ends of things;
living quite out of the world in which such things are usually
done, and knowing no better (or rather no worse) than to get
his book made by the appropriate craftsman and hawk it round
like any other ware."</p>

<p>It is more than likely that Davies' first notoriety as a tramp-poet
who had ridden the rails in the United States and had
had his right foot cut off by a train in Canada, obscured his
merits as a genuine singer. Even his early <i>The Soul's Destroyer</i>
(1907) revealed that simplicity which is as <i>na&iuml;f</i> as it is
strange. The volumes that followed are more clearly melodious,
more like the visionary wonder of Blake, more artistically
artless.</p>

<p>With the exception of "The Villain," which has not yet appeared
in book form, the following poems are taken from <i>The
Collected Poems of W. H. Davies</i> (1916) with the permission
of the publisher, Alfred A. Knopf.</p>

<h2><i>Hilaire Belloc</i></h2>


<p>Hilaire Belloc, who has been described as "a Frenchman, an
Englishman, an Oxford man, a country gentleman, a soldier, a
satirist, a democrat, a novelist, and a practical journalist,"
was born July 27, 1870. After leaving school he served as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
driver in the 8th Regiment of French Artillery at Toul Meurthe-et-Moselle,
being at that time a French citizen. He was naturalized
as a British subject somewhat later, and in 1906 he entered
the House of Commons as Liberal Member for South Salford.</p>

<p>As an author, he has engaged in multiple activities. He has
written three satirical novels, one of which, <i>Mr. Clutterbuck's
Election</i>, sharply exposes British newspapers and underground
politics. His <i>Path to Rome</i> (1902) is a high-spirited and ever-delightful
travel book which has passed through many editions.
His historical studies and biographies of <i>Robespierre</i> and <i>Marie
Antoinette</i> (1909) are classics of their kind. As a poet he is
only somewhat less engaging. His <i>Verses</i> (1910) is a rather
brief collection of poems on a wide variety of themes. Although
his humorous and burlesque stanzas are refreshing, Belloc is
most himself when he writes either of malt liquor or his beloved
Sussex. Though his religious poems are full of a fine romanticism,
"The South Country" is the most pictorial and persuasive
of his serious poems. His poetic as well as his spiritual
kinship with G. K. Chesterton is obvious.</p>

<h2><i>J. M. Synge</i></h2>


<p>The most brilliant star of the Celtic revival was born at
Rathfarnham, near Dublin, in 1871. As a child in Wicklow,
he was already fascinated by the strange idioms and the rhythmic
speech he heard there, a native utterance which was his
greatest delight and which was to be rich material for his greatest
work. He did not use this folk-language merely as he
heard it. He was an artist first and last, and as an artist
he bent and shaped the rough material, selecting with great
fastidiousness, so that in his plays every speech is, as he himself
declared all good speech should be, "as fully flavored as a
nut or apple." Even in <i>The Tinker's Wedding</i> (1907), pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>sibly
the least important of his plays, one is arrested by
snatches like:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That's a sweet tongue you have, Sarah Casey; but if
sleep's a grand thing, it's a grand thing to be waking up
a day the like of this, when there's a warm sun in it, and
a kind air, and you'll hear the cuckoos singing and crying
out on the top of the hill."</p></div>

<p>For some time, Synge's career was uncertain. He went to
Germany half intending to become a professional musician.
There he studied the theory of music, perfecting himself meanwhile
in Gaelic and Hebrew, winning prizes in both of these
languages. Yeats found him in France in 1898 and advised
him to go to the Aran Islands, to live there as if he were one
of the people. "Express a life," said Yeats, "that has never
found expression." Synge went. He became part of the life
of Aran, living upon salt fish and eggs, talking Irish for the
most part but listening also to that beautiful English which,
to quote Yeats again, "has grown up in Irish-speaking districts
and takes its vocabulary from the time of Malory and of
the translators of the Bible, but its idiom and vivid metaphor
from Irish." The result of this close contact was five of the
greatest poetic prose dramas not only of his own generation,
but of several generations preceding it. (See Preface.)</p>

<p>In <i>Riders to the Sea</i> (1903), <i>The Well of the Saints</i> (1905),
and <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> (1907) we have a
richness of imagery, a new language startling in its vigor, a
wildness and passion that contrast strangely with the suave
mysticism and delicate spirituality of his associates in the Irish
Theatre.</p>

<p>Synge's <i>Poems and Translations</i> (1910), a volume which was
not issued until after his death, contains not only his few hard
and earthy verses, but also Synge's theory of poetry. The
translations, which have been rendered in a highly intensified
prose, are as racy as anything in his plays; his versions of
Villon and Petrarch are remarkable for their adherence to the
original and still radiate the poet's own personality.</p>

<p>Synge died, just as he was beginning to attain fame, at a
private hospital in Dublin March 24, 1909.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h2><i>Eva Gore-Booth</i></h2>


<p>Eva Gore-Booth, the second daughter of Sir Henry Gore-Booth
and the sister of Countess Marcievicz, was born in Sligo,
Ireland, in 1872. She first appeared in "A. E."'s anthology,
<i>New Songs</i>, in which so many of the modern Irish poets first
came forward.</p>

<p>Her initial volume, <i>Poems</i> (1898), showed practically no distinction&mdash;not
even the customary "promise." But <i>The One and
the Many</i> (1904) and <i>The Sorrowful Princess</i> (1907) revealed
the gift of the Celtic singer who is half mystic, half minstrel.
Primarily philosophic, her verse often turns to lyrics as haunting
as the two examples here reprinted.</p>

<h2><i>John McCrae</i></h2>


<p>John McCrae was born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, in 1872.
He was graduated in arts in 1894 and in medicine in 1898. He
finished his studies at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and returned
to Canada, joining the staff of the Medical School of McGill
University. He was a lieutenant of artillery in South Africa
(1899-1900) and was in charge of the Medical Division of the
McGill Canadian General Hospital during the World War.
After serving two years, he died of pneumonia, January, 1918,
his volume <i>In Flanders Fields</i> (1919) appearing posthumously.</p>

<p>Few who read the title poem of his book, possibly the most
widely-read poem produced by the war, realize that it is a
perfect rondeau, one of the loveliest (and strictest) of the
French forms.</p>

<h2><i>Walter De la Mare</i></h2>


<p>The author of some of the most haunting lyrics in contemporary
poetry, Walter De la Mare, was born in 1873. Although
he did not begin to bring out his work in book form
until he was over 30, he is, as Harold Williams has written,
"the singer of a young and romantic world, a singer even for
children, understanding and perceiving as a child." De la
Mare paints simple scenes of miniature loveliness; he uses
thin-spun fragments of fairy-like delicacy and achieves a grace
that is remarkable in its universality. "In a few words, seemingly
artless and unsought" (to quote Williams again), "he
can express a pathos or a hope as wide as man's life."</p>

<p>De la Mare is an astonishing joiner of words; in <i>Peacock
Pie</i> (1913) he surprises us again and again by transforming
what began as a child's nonsense-rhyme into a suddenly thrilling
snatch of music. A score of times he takes things as casual
as the feeding of chickens or the swallowing of physic, berry-picking,
eating, hair-cutting&mdash;and turns them into magic. These
poems read like lyrics of William Shakespeare rendered by
Mother Goose. The trick of revealing the ordinary in whimsical
colors, of catching the commonplace off its guard, is the
first of De la Mare's two magics.</p>

<p>This poet's second gift is his sense of the supernatural, of the
fantastic other-world that lies on the edges of our consciousness.
<i>The Listeners</i> (1912) is a book that, like all the best of
De la Mare, is full of half-heard whispers; moonlight and
mystery seem soaked in the lines, and a cool wind from Nowhere
blows over them. That most magical of modern verses,
"The Listeners," and the brief music of "An Epitaph" are
two fine examples among many. In the first of these poems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
there is an uncanny splendor. What we have here is the effect,
the thrill, the overtones of a ghost story rather than the narrative
itself&mdash;the less than half-told adventure of some new
Childe Roland heroically challenging a heedless universe.
Never have silence and black night been reproduced more
creepily, nor has the symbolism of man's courage facing the
cryptic riddle of life been more memorably expressed.</p>

<p>De la Mare's chief distinction, however, lies not so much
in what he says as in how he says it; he can even take outworn
words like "thridding," "athwart," "amaranthine" and
make them live again in a poetry that is of no time and of
all time. He writes, it has been said, as much for antiquity as
for posterity; he is a poet who is distinctively in the world
and yet not wholly of it.</p>

<h2><i>G. K. Chesterton</i></h2>


<p>This brilliant journalist, novelist, essayist, publicist and lyricist,
Gilbert Keith Chesterton, was born at Campden Hill,
Kensington, in 1874, and began his literary life by reviewing
books on art for various magazines. He is best known as a
writer of flashing, paradoxical essays on anything and everything,
like <i>Tremendous Trifles</i> (1909), <i>Varied Types</i> (1905),
and <i>All Things Considered</i> (1910). But he is also a stimulating
critic; a keen appraiser, as in his volume <i>Heretics</i> (1905)
and his analytical studies of Robert Browning, Charles Dickens,
and George Bernard Shaw; a writer of strange and grotesque
romances like <i>The Napoleon of Notting Hill</i> (1906),
<i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> (1908), which Chesterton himself
has subtitled "A Nightmare," and <i>The Flying Inn</i> (1914);
the author of several books of fantastic short stories, ranging
from the wildly whimsical narratives in <i>The Club of Queer
Trades</i> (1905) to that amazing sequence <i>The Innocence of
Father Brown</i> (1911)&mdash;which is a series of religious detective
stories!</p>

<p>Besides being the creator of all of these, Chesterton finds
time to be a prolific if sometimes too acrobatic newspaperman,
a lay preacher in disguise (witness <i>Orthodoxy</i> [1908], <i>What's
Wrong with the World?</i> [1910], <i>The Ball and the Cross</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
[1909]), a pamphleteer, and a poet. His first volume of verse,
<i>The Wild Knight and Other Poems</i> (1900), a collection of
quaintly-flavored and affirmative verses, was followed by <i>The
Ballad of the White Horse</i> (1911), one long poem which, in
spite of Chesterton's ever-present didactic sermonizing, is possibly
the most stirring creation he has achieved. This poem
has the swing, the vigor, the spontaneity, and, above all, the
ageless simplicity of the true narrative ballad.</p>

<p>Scarcely less notable is the ringing "Lepanto" from his later
<i>Poems</i> (1915) which, anticipating the banging, clanging verses
of Vachel Lindsay's "The Congo," is one of the finest of modern
chants. It is interesting to see how the syllables beat, as
though on brass; it is thrilling to feel how, in one's pulses, the
armies sing, the feet tramp, the drums snarl, and all the tides
of marching crusaders roll out of lines like:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don John of Austria is going to the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chesterton, the prose-paradoxer, is a delightful product of a
skeptical age. But it is Chesterton the poet who is more likely
to outlive it.</p>

<h2><i>Wilfrid Wilson Gibson</i></h2>


<p>Born at Hexam in 1878, Wilfrid Wilson Gibson has published
almost a dozen books of verse&mdash;the first four or five (see
Preface) being imitative in manner and sentimentally romantic
in tone. With <i>The Stonefolds</i> (1907) and <i>Daily Bread</i> (1910),
Gibson executed a complete right-about-face and, with dramatic
brevity, wrote a series of poems mirroring the dreams,
pursuits and fears of common humanity. <i>Fires</i> (1912) marks
an advance in technique and power. And though in <i>Livelihood</i>
(1917) Gibson seems to be theatricalizing and merely
exploiting his working-people, his later lyrics recapture the
veracity of such memorable poems as "The Old Man," "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Blind Rower," and "The Machine." <i>Hill-Tracks</i> (1918) attempts
to capture the beauty of village-names and the glamour
of the English countryside.</p>

<span class="i0">As one, at midnight, wakened by the call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of golden-plovers in their seaward flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lies and listens, as the clear notes fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through tingling silence of the frosty night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lies and listens, till the last note fails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, in fancy, faring with the flock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far over slumbering hills and dreaming dales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon hears the surges break on reef and rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hearkening, till all sense of self is drowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the mightier music of the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more remembers the sweet piping sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That startled him from dull, undreaming sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I, first waking from oblivion, heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heart that kindled to the call of song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of young life, fluting like a bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And echoed that light lilting; till, ere long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lured onward by that happy, singing-flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I caught the stormy summons of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dared the restless deeps that, day and night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surge with the life-song of humanity.<br /></span>

<h2><i>John Masefield</i></h2>


<p>John Masefield was born June 1, 1878, in Ledbury, Hertfordshire.
He was the son of a lawyer but, being of a restless disposition,
he took to the sea at an early age and became a
wanderer for several years. At one time, in 1895, to be exact,
he worked for a few months as a sort of third assistant barkeeper
and dish-washer in Luke O'Connor's saloon, the Columbia
Hotel, in New York City. The place is still there on the
corner of Sixth and Greenwich Avenues.</p>

<p>The results of his wanderings showed in his early works,
<i>Salt-Water Ballads</i> (1902), <i>Ballads</i> (1903), frank and often
crude poems of sailors written in their own dialect, and <i>A
Mainsail Haul</i> (1905), a collection of short nautical stories. In
these books Masefield possibly overemphasized passion and
brutality but, underneath the violence, he captured that highly-colored
realism which is the poetry of life.</p>

<p>It was not until he published <i>The Everlasting Mercy</i> (1911)
that he became famous. Followed quickly by those remarkable
long narrative poems, <i>The Widow in the Bye Street</i> (1912),
<i>Dauber</i> (1912), and <i>The Daffodil Fields</i> (1913), there is in all
of these that peculiar blend of physical exulting and spiritual
exaltation that is so striking, and so typical of Masefield.
Their very rudeness is lifted to a plane of religious intensity.
(See Preface.) Pictorially, Masefield is even more forceful.
The finest moment in <i>The Widow in the Bye Street</i> is the por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>trayal
of the mother alone in her cottage; the public-house
scene and the passage describing the birds following the plough
are the most intense touches in <i>The Everlasting Mercy</i>. Nothing
more vigorous and thrilling than the description of the
storm at sea in <i>Dauber</i> has appeared in current literature.</p>

<p>The war, in which Masefield served with the Red Cross in
France and on the Gallipoli peninsula (of which campaign he
wrote a study for the government), softened his style; <i>Good
Friday and Other Poems</i> (1916) is as restrained and dignified
a collection as that of any of his contemporaries. <i>Reynard the
Fox</i> (1919) is the best of his new manner with a return of the
old vivacity.</p>

<p>Masefield has also written several novels of which <i>Multitude
and Solitude</i> (1909) is the most outstanding; half a dozen
plays, ranging from the classical solemnity of <i>Pompey the
Great</i> to the hot and racy <i>Tragedy of Nan</i>; and one of the
freshest, most creative critiques of <i>Shakespeare</i> (1911) in the
last generation.</p>

<h2><i>Lord Dunsany</i></h2>


<p>Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, Lord Dunsany, was
born July 24, 1878, and was educated at Eton and Sandhurst.
He is best known as an author of fantastic fairy tales and even
more fantastic plays. <i>The Gods of the Mountain</i> (1911) and
<i>The Golden Doom</i> (1912) are highly dramatic and intensely
poetic. <i>A Night at an Inn</i> (1916) is that peculiar novelty, an
eerie and poetical melodrama.</p>

<p>Dunsany's prime quality is a romantic and highly colored
imagination which is rich in symbolism. After the World War,
in which the playwright served as captain in the Royal Innis-killing
Fusiliers, Dunsany visited America and revised the reissue
of his early tales and prose poems collected in his <i>The
Book of Wonder</i>.</p>

<h2><i>Edward Thomas</i></h2>


<p>Edward Thomas, one of the little-known but most individual
of modern English poets, was born in 1878. For many years
before he turned to verse, Thomas had a large following as a
critic and author of travel books, biographies, pot-boilers.
Hating his hack-work, yet unable to get free of it, he had so
repressed his creative ability that he had grown doubtful concerning
his own power. It needed something foreign to stir
and animate what was native in him. So when Robert Frost,
the New England poet, went abroad in 1912 for two years and
became an intimate of Thomas's, the English critic began to
write poetry. Loving, like Frost, the <i>minuti&aelig;</i> of existence, the
quaint and casual turn of ordinary life, he caught the magic
of the English countryside in its unpoeticized quietude. Many
of his poems are full of a slow, sad contemplation of life and
a reflection of its brave futility. It is not disillusion exactly;
it is rather an absence of illusion. <i>Poems</i> (1917), dedicated to
Robert Frost, is full of Thomas's fidelity to little things, things
as unglorified as the unfreezing of the "rock-like mud," a
child's path, a list of quaint-sounding villages, birds' nests
uncovered by the autumn wind, dusty nettles&mdash;the lines glow
with a deep and almost abject reverence for the soil.</p>

<p>Thomas was killed at Arras, at an observatory outpost, on
Easter Monday, 1917.</p>

<h2><i>Ralph Hodgson</i></h2>


<p>This exquisite poet was born in Northumberland about 1879.
One of the most graceful of the younger word-magicians, Ralph
Hodgson will retain his freshness as long as there are lovers
of such rare and timeless songs as his. It is difficult to think
of any anthology of English poetry compiled after 1917 that
could omit "Eve," "The Song of Honor," and that memorable
snatch of music, "Time, You Old Gypsy Man." One succumbs
to the charm of "Eve" at the first reading; for here is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
oldest of all legends told with a surprising simplicity and
still more surprising freshness. This Eve is neither the conscious
sinner nor the Mother of men; she is, in Hodgson's
candid lines, any young, English country girl&mdash;filling her
basket, regarding the world and the serpent itself with a mild
and childlike wonder.</p>

<p>Hodgson's verses, full of the love of all natural things, a
love that goes out to</p>

<h2><i>Harold Monro</i></h2>


<p>The publisher of the various anthologies of Georgian Poetry,
Harold Monro, was born in Brussels in 1879. He describes
himself as "author, publisher, editor and book-seller." Monro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
founded The Poetry Bookshop in London in 1912, a unique
establishment having as its object a practical relation between
poetry and the public, and keeping in stock nothing but poetry,
the drama, and books connected with these subjects. His quarterly
<i>Poetry and Drama</i> (discontinued during the war and revived
in 1919 as <i>The Monthly Chapbook</i>), was in a sense the
organ of the younger men; and his shop, in which he has lived
for the last seven years except while he was in the army,
became a genuine literary center.</p>

<p>Of Monro's books, the two most important are <i>Strange Meetings</i>
(1917) and <i>Children of Love</i> (1919). "The Nightingale
Near the House," one of the loveliest of his poems, is also one
of his latest and has not yet appeared in any of his volumes.</p>

<h2><i>T. M. Kettle</i></h2>


<p>Thomas M. Kettle was born at Artane County, Dublin, in
1880 and was educated at University College, where he won
the Gold Medal for Oratory. His extraordinary faculty for
grasping an intricate problem and crystallizing it in an epigram,
or scoring his adversaries with one bright flash, was
apparent even then. He was admitted to the bar in 1905 but
soon abandoned the law to devote himself to journalism, which,
because of his remarkable style, never remained journalism
in his hands. In 1906 he entered politics; in 1910 he was
re-elected for East Tyrone. Even his bitterest opponents conceded
that Tom Kettle (as he was called by friend and enemy)
was the most honorable of fighters; they acknowledged his
honesty, courage and devotion to the cause of a United Ireland&mdash;and
respected his penetrating wit. He once spoke of a Mr.
Healy as "a brilliant calamity" and satirized a long-winded
speaker by saying, "Mr. Long knows a sentence should have a
beginning, but he quite forgets it should also have an end."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"An Irish torch-bearer" (so E. B. Osborn calls him), Kettle
fell in action at Ginchy, leading his Fusiliers in September,
1916. The uplifted poem to his daughter was written shortly
before his death.</p>

<h2><i>Alfred Noyes</i></h2>


<p>Alfred Noyes was born at Staffordshire, September 16, 1880.
He is one of the few contemporary poets who have been fortunate
enough to write a kind of poetry that is not only saleable
but popular with many classes of people.</p>

<p>His first book, <i>The Loom of Years</i> (1902), was published
when he was only 22 years old, and <i>Poems</i> (1904) intensified
the promise of his first publication. Swinburne, grown old and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
living in retirement, was so struck with Noyes's talent that he
had the young poet out to read to him. Unfortunately, Noyes
has not developed his gifts as deeply as his admirers have
hoped. His poetry, extremely straightforward and rhythmical,
has often degenerated into cheap sentimentalities and cheaper
tirades; it has frequently attempted to express programs and
profundities far beyond Noyes's power.</p>

<p>What is most appealing about his best verse is its ease and
heartiness; this singer's gift lies in the almost personal bond
established between the poet and his public. People have such
a good time reading his vivacious lines because Noyes had such
a good time writing them. Rhyme in a thumping rhythm seems
to be not merely his trade but his morning exercise. Noyes's
own relish filled and quickened glees and catches like <i>Forty
Singing Seamen</i> (1907), the lusty choruses in <i>Tales of the
Mermaid Tavern</i> (1913), and the genuinely inspired nonsense
of the earlier <i>Forest of Wild Thyme</i> (1905).</p>

<p>The least popular work of Noyes is, as a unified product,
his most remarkable performance. It is an epic in twelve
books of blank verse, <i>Drake</i> (1908), a glowing pageant of the
sea and England's drama upon it. It is a spirited echo of the
maritime Elizabethans; a vivid and orchestral work interspersed
with splendid lyric passages and brisk songs. The
companion volume, an attempted reconstruction of the literary
phase of the same period, is less successful; but these <i>Tales
of the Mermaid Tavern</i> (which introduce Shakespeare, Marlowe,
Drayton, Raleigh, Ben Jonson, and other immortals) are
alive and colorful, if somewhat too insistently rollicking and
smoothly lilting.</p>

<p>His eight volumes were assembled in 1913 and published in
two books of <i>Collected Poems</i> (Frederick A. Stokes Company).</p>

<h2><i>Padraic Colum</i></h2>


<p>Padraic Colum was born at Longford, Ireland (in the same
county as Oliver Goldsmith), December 8, 1881, and was educated
at the local schools. At 20 he was a member of a group
that created the Irish National Theatre, afterwards called The
Abbey Theatre.</p>

<p>Colum began as a dramatist with <i>Broken Soil</i> (1904), <i>The
Land</i> (1905), <i>Thomas Muskerry</i> (1910), and this early dramatic
influence has colored much of his work, his best poetry being
in the form of dramatic lyrics. <i>Wild Earth</i>, his most notable
collection of verse, first appeared in 1909, and an amplified edition
of it was published in America in 1916.</p>

<h2><i>James Stephens</i></h2>


<p>This unique personality was born in Dublin in February,
1882. Stephens was discovered in an office and saved from
clerical slavery by George Russell ("A. E."). Always a poet,
Stephens's most poetic moments are in his highly-colored prose.
And yet, although the finest of his novels, <i>The Crock of Gold</i>
(1912), contains more wild phantasy and quaint imagery than
all his volumes of verse, his <i>Insurrections</i> (1909) and <i>The Hill
of Vision</i> (1912) reveal a rebellious spirit that is at once hotly
ironic and coolly whimsical.</p>

<p>Stephens's outstanding characteristic is his delightful blend of
incongruities&mdash;he combines in his verse the grotesque, the
buoyant and the profound. No fresher or more brightly vigorous
imagination has come out of Ireland since J. M. Synge.</p>

<h2><i>J. C. Squire</i></h2>


<p>Jack Collings Squire was born April 2, 1884, at Plymouth, of
Devonian ancestry. He was educated at Blundell's and Cambridge
University, and became known first as a remarkably
adroit parodist. His <i>Imaginary Speeches</i> (1912) and <i>Tricks
of the Trade</i> (1917) are amusing parodies and, what is more,
excellent criticism. He edited <i>The New Statesman</i> for a while
and founded <i>The London Mercury</i> (a monthly of which he is
editor) in November, 1919. Under the pseudonym "Solomon
Eagle" he wrote a page of literary criticism every week for
six years, many of these papers being collected in his volume,
<i>Books in General</i> (1919).</p>

<p>His original poetry is intellectual but simple, sometimes
metaphysical and always interesting technically in its fluent and
variable rhythms. A collection of his best verse up to 1919
was published under the title, <i>Poems: First Series</i>.</p>

<h2><i>Lascelles Abercrombie</i></h2>


<p>Lascelles Abercrombie was born in 1884. Like Masefield, he
gained his reputation rapidly; totally unknown until 1909, upon
the publication of <i>Interludes and Poems</i>, he was recognized as
one of the greatest metaphysical poets of his period. <i>Emblems
of Love</i> (1912), the ripest collection of his blank verse dialogues,
justified the enthusiasm of his admirers.</p>

<p>Many of Abercrombie's poems, the best of which are too long
to quote, are founded on scriptural themes, but his blank verse
is not biblical either in mood or manner. It is the undercurrent
rather than the surface of his verse which moves with a
strong religious conviction. Abercrombie's images are daring
and brilliant; his lines, sometimes too closely packed, glow
with a dazzling intensity that is warmly spiritual and fervently
human.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<h2><i>James Elroy Flecker</i></h2>


<p>Another remarkable poet whose early death was a blow to
English literature, James Elroy Flecker, was born in London,
November 5, 1884. Possibly due to his low vitality, Flecker
found little to interest him but a classical reaction against
realism in verse, a delight in verbal craftsmanship, and a passion
for technical perfection&mdash;especially the deliberate technique
of the French Parnassians whom he worshipped. Flecker was
opposed to any art that was emotional or that "taught" anything.
"The poet's business," he declared, "is not to save the
soul of man, but to make it worth saving."</p>

<p>The advent of the war began to make Flecker's verse more
personal and romantic. The tuberculosis that finally killed
him at Davos Platz, Switzerland, January 3, 1915, forced him
from an Olympian disinterest to a deep concern with life and
death. He passionately denied that he was weary of living
"as the pallid poets are," and he was attempting higher flights
of song when his singing ceased altogether.</p>

<p>His two colorful volumes are <i>The Golden Journey to
Samarkand</i> (1913) and <i>The Old Ships</i> (1915).</p>

<h2><i>D. H. Lawrence</i></h2>


<p>David Herbert Lawrence, born in 1885, is one of the most
psychologically intense of the modern poets. This intensity,
ranging from a febrile morbidity to an exalted and almost
frenzied mysticism, is seen even in his prose works&mdash;particularly
in his short stories, <i>The Prussian Officer</i> (1917), his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
analytical <i>Sons and Lovers</i> (1913), and the rhapsodic novel,
<i>The Rainbow</i> (1915).</p>

<p>As a poet he is often caught in the net of his own emotions;
his passion thickens his utterance and distorts his rhythms,
which sometimes seem purposely harsh and bitter-flavored. But
within his range he is as powerful as he is poignant. His most
notable volumes of poetry are <i>Amores</i> (1916), <i>Look! We Have
Come Through!</i> (1918), and <i>New Poems</i> (1920).</p>

<h2><i>Siegfried Sassoon</i></h2>


<p>Siegfried Loraine Sassoon, the poet whom Masefield hailed
as "one of England's most brilliant rising stars," was born
September 8, 1886. He was educated at Marlborough and
Clare College, Cambridge, and was a captain in the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers. He fought three times in France, once in
Palestine, winning the Military Cross for bringing in wounded
on the battlefield.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>His poetry divides itself sharply in two moods&mdash;the lyric
and the ironic. His early lilting poems were without significance
or individuality. But with <i>The Old Huntsman</i> (1917)
Sassoon found his own idiom, and became one of the leading
younger poets upon the appearance of this striking volume.
The first poem, a long monologue evidently inspired by Masefield,
gave little evidence of what was to come. Immediately
following it, however, came a series of war poems, undisguised
in their tragedy and bitterness. Every line of these
quivering stanzas bore the mark of a sensitive and outraged
nature; there was scarcely a phrase that did not protest against
the "glorification" and false glamour of war.</p>

<p><i>Counter-Attack</i> appeared in 1918. In this volume Sassoon
turned entirely from an ordered loveliness to the gigantic brutality
of war. At heart a lyric idealist, the bloody years intensified
and twisted his tenderness till what was stubborn and
satiric in him forced its way to the top. In <i>Counter-Attack</i>
Sassoon found his angry outlet. Most of these poems are
choked with passion; many of them are torn out, roots and all,
from the very core of an intense conviction; they rush on, not
so much because of the poet's art but almost in spite of it. A
suave utterance, a neatly-joined structure would be out of
place and even inexcusable in poems like "The Rear-Guard,"
"To Any Dead Officer," "Does It Matter?"&mdash;verses that are
composed of love, fever and indignation.</p>

<p>Can Sassoon see nothing glorious or uplifting in war? His
friend, Robert Nichols, another poet and soldier, speaks for him
in a preface. "Let no one ever," Nichols quotes Sassoon as
saying, "from henceforth say one word in any way countenancing
war. It is dangerous even to speak of how here and there
the individual may gain some hardship of soul by it. For war
is hell, and those who institute it are criminals. Were there
even anything to say for it, it should not be said; for its
spiritual disasters far outweigh any of its advantages...."
Nichols adds his approval to these sentences, saying, "For
myself, this is the truth. War does not ennoble, it degrades."</p>

<p>Early in 1920 Sassoon visited America. At the same time
he brought out his <i>Picture Show</i> (1920), a vigorous answer to
those who feared that Sassoon had "written himself out" or
had begun to burn away in his own fire. Had Rupert Brooke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
lived, he might have written many of these lacerated but somehow
exalted lines. Sassoon's three volumes are the most vital
and unsparing records of the war we have had. They synthesize
in poetry what Barbusse's <i>Under Fire</i> spreads out in
panoramic prose.</p>

<h2><i>Rupert Brooke</i></h2>


<p>Possibly the most famous of the Georgians, Rupert Brooke,
was born at Rugby in August, 1887, his father being assistant
master at the school. As a youth, Brooke was keenly interested
in all forms of athletics; playing cricket, football, tennis, and
swimming as well as most professionals. He was six feet tall,
his finely molded head topped with a crown of loose hair of
lively brown; "a golden young Apollo," said Edward Thomas.
Another friend of his wrote, "to look at, he was part of the
youth of the world. He was one of the handsomest Englishmen
of his time." His beauty overstressed somewhat his naturally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
romantic disposition; his early poems are a blend of delight in
the splendor of actuality and disillusion in a loveliness that
dies. The shadow of John Donne lies over his pages.</p>

<p>This occasional cynicism was purged, when after several
years of travel (he had been to Germany, Italy and Honolulu)
the war came, turning Brooke away from</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"A world grown old and cold and weary ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half men, and their dirty songs and dreary,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all the little emptiness of love."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Brooke enlisted with a relief that was like a rebirth; he
sought a new energy in the struggle "where the worst friend
and enemy is but Death." After seeing service in Belgium,
1914, he spent the following winter in a training-camp in
Dorsetshire and sailed with the British Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force in February, 1915, to take part in the unfortunate
Dardenelles Campaign.</p>

<p>Brooke never reached his destination. He died of blood-poison
at Skyros, April 23, 1915. His early death was one of
England's great literary losses; Lascelles Abercrombie, W. W.
Gibson (with both of whom he had been associated on the
quarterly, <i>New Numbers</i>), Walter De la Mare, the Hon.
Winston Spencer Churchill, and a host of others united to pay
tribute to the most brilliant and passionate of the younger poets.</p>

<p>Brooke's sonnet-sequence, <i>1914</i> (from which "The Soldier"
is taken), which, with prophetic irony, appeared a few weeks
before his death, contains the accents of immortality. And
"The Old Vicarage, Grantchester" (unfortunately too long
to reprint in this volume), is fully as characteristic of the lighter
and more playful side of Brooke's temperament. Both these
phases are combined in "The Great Lover," of which Abercrombie
has written, "It is life he loves, and not in any abstract
sense, but all the infinite little familiar details of life,
remembered and catalogued with delightful zest."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<h2><i>Winifred M. Letts</i></h2>


<p>Winifred M. Letts was born in Ireland in 1887, and her early
work concerned itself almost entirely with the humor and pathos
found in her immediate surroundings. Her <i>Songs from Leinster</i>
(1913) is her most characteristic collection; a volume full of
the poetry of simple people and humble souls. Although she has
called herself "a back-door sort of bard," she is particularly
effective in the old ballad measure and in her quaint portrayal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of Irish peasants rather than of Gaelic kings and pagan heroes.
She has also written three novels, five books for children, a
later volume of <i>Poems of the War</i> and, during the conflict,
served as a nurse at various base hospitals.</p>

until his appearance in <i>Georgian Poetry 1916-17</i>, has written
no few delicate and fanciful poems. <i>The Hunter</i> (1916)

<h2><i>Patrick MacGill</i></h2>


<p>Patrick MacGill was born in Donegal in 1890. He was the
son of poverty-stricken peasants and, between the ages of 12
and 19, he worked as farm-servant, drainer, potato-digger, and
navvy, becoming one of the thousands of stray "tramp-laborers"
who cross each summer from Ireland to Scotland to help
gather in the crops. Out of his bitter experiences and the evils
of modern industrial life, he wrote several vivid novels (<i>The
Rat Pit</i> is an unforgettable document) and the tragedy-crammed
<i>Songs of the Dead End</i>. He joined the editorial staff of <i>The
Daily Express</i> in 1911; was in the British army during the
war; was wounded at Loos in 1915; and wrote his <i>Soldier
Songs</i> during the conflict.</p>

<h2><i>Francis Ledwidge</i></h2>


<p>Francis Ledwidge was born in Slane, County Meath, Ireland,
in 1891. His brief life was fitful and romantic. He was, at
various times, a miner, a grocer's clerk, a farmer, a scavenger,
an experimenter in hypnotism, and, at the end, a soldier. He
served as a lance-corporal on the Flanders front and was
killed in July, 1917, at the age of 26 years.</p>

<p>Ledwidge's poetry is rich in nature imagery; his lines are
full of color, in the manner of Keats, and unaffectedly melodious.</p>

<h2><i>Richard Aldington</i></h2>


<p>Richard Aldington was born in England in 1892, and educated
at Dover College and London University. His first poems
were published in England in 1909; <i>Images Old and New</i> appeared
in 1915. Aldington and "H. D." (Hilda Doolittle, his
American wife) are conceded to be two of the foremost imagist
poets; their sensitive, firm and clean-cut lines put to shame
their scores of imitators. Aldington's <i>War and Love</i> (1918),
from which "Prelude" is taken, is somewhat more regular in
pattern; the poems in this latter volume are less consciously
artistic but warmer and more humanly searching.</p>

<h2><i>Osbert Sitwell</i></h2>


<p>Born in London, December 6th, 1892, Osbert Sitwell (son of
Sir George Sitwell and brother of Edith Sitwell) was educated
at Eton and became an officer in the Grenadier Guards,
with whom he served in France for various periods from 1914
to 1917.</p>

<p>His first contributions appeared in <i>Wheels</i> (an annual
anthology of a few of the younger radical writers, edited by
his sister) and disclosed an ironic and strongly individual
touch. That impression is strengthened by a reading of
<i>Argonaut and Juggernaut</i> (1920), where Sitwell's cleverness
and satire are fused. His most remarkable though his least
brilliant poems are his irregular and fiery protests against
smugness and hypocrisy. But even Sitwell's more conventional
poetry has a freshness of movement and definiteness of outline.</p>

<h2><i>Robert Nichols</i></h2>


<p>Robert Nichols was born on the Isle of Wight in 1893. His
first volume, <i>Invocations</i> (1915), was published while he was
at the front, Nichols having joined the army while he was still
an undergraduate at Trinity College, Oxford. After serving
one year as second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery, he
was incapacitated by shell shock, visiting America in 1918-19
as a lecturer. His <i>Ardours and Endurances</i> (1917) is the most
representative work of this poet, although his new volume,
<i>The Flower of Flame</i> (1920), shows a steady advance in
power.</p>

<h2><i>Charles Hamilton Sorley</i></h2>


<p>Charles Hamilton Sorley, who promised greater things than
any of the younger poets, was born at Old Aberdeen in May,
1895. He studied at Marlborough College and University
College, Oxford. He was finishing his studies abroad and was
on a walking-tour along the banks of the Moselle when the
war came. Sorley returned home to receive an immediate commission
in the 7th Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment. In August,
1915, at the age of 20, he was made a captain. On October
13, 1915, he was killed in action near Hulluch.</p>

<p>Sorley left but one book, <i>Marlborough and Other Poems</i>. The
verse contained in it is sometimes rough but never rude. Although
he admired Masefield, loveliness rather than liveliness
was his aim. Restraint, tolerance, and a dignity unusual for a
boy of 20, distinguish his poetry.</p>

<h2><i>Robert Graves</i></h2>


<p>Robert Graves was born July 26, 1895. One of "the three
rhyming musketeers" (the other two being the poets Siegfried
Sassoon and Robert Nichols), he was one of several writers
who, roused by the war and giving himself to his country,
refused to glorify warfare or chant new hymns of hate. Like
Sassoon, Graves also reacts against the storm of fury and
blood-lust (see his poem "To a Dead Boche"), but, fortified
by a lighter and more whimsical spirit, where Sassoon is violent,
Graves is volatile; where Sassoon is bitter, Graves is
almost blithe.</p>

<p>An unconquerable gayety rises from his <i>Fairies and Fusiliers</i>
(1917), a surprising and healing humor that is warmly indi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>vidual.
In <i>Country Sentiment</i> (1919) Graves turns to a fresh
and more serious simplicity. But a buoyant fancy ripples beneath
the most archaic of his ballads and a quaintly original
turn of mind saves them from their own echoes.</p>
